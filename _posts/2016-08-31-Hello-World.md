# What is Atriva Media?

Atriva Media provides a media cloud service for you to perserve, organize, and share your valuable photos and videos, and even collaborate with your friends and family, all in one place! Just create a media channel and add your favorite photos and videos, you can keep it as private collection or share it with family and friends. We will keep it organized forever. Your can tell the whole stories of your favorite moments in media channels that you and your friends and family can easily enjoy anytime on mobile devices as well as TV at home!

# Why not using social network?

It’s easy to share photos and video to friends around the world with social network. But it’s not easy to share the precious memory with close family and preserve for long time with privacy in the same place. Photos and videos in the social networks are not considered to be organized and private for long term preservation.

# Why have we started Atriva Media?

We love to take family photos and share with all the family. Family photos are valuable, private and worth to preserve forever! However, when we want to share them over the Internet, it is very difficult to keep them secured, private and organized. We tried all kinds of solutions including social network, instant message, cloud storage, cloud-enable local storage, etc. None of them provides enough private, secured, ease of use, collaborative, and family friendly, all together! So we decided to build one!

# What’s is the problem that we are trying to solve?

We create Atriva Media to solve the three major problems:

1.	<u>Valuable photos are always buried in camera roll and un-organized</u> – You can create media channels for your private collections, family channels, social events, etc. You control who and when to share.
2.	<u>Family photos are always scattered across multiple devices and difficult to aggregate</u> – We allow you to collaborate on media channels for everybody can contribute and enjoy, all in the same place.
3.	<u>Shared photos always stay in multiple Apps, or even web links, un-secured, no privacy and un-friendly to all family</u> – We help you and all your family to enjoy organized photos and videos on mobile device or TV, no matter their level of technical expertise.
